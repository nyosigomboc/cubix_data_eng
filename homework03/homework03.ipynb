    "Create a script which asks the user to input data and calculates with that input.\n",
    "Tasks:\n",
    "1.Ask the user to type an INTEGER number between 1 and 30 (INPUT)\n",
    "2.Check if the input is correct:\n",
    "  a.If the user inputs a TEXT, print a message: 'Type a NUMBER, not a text!'\n",
    "  b.If the user inputs a number which is NOT INTEGER, print a message: 'Number must be INTEGER!'\n",
    "  c.If the user inputs an integer NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 30, print a message: 'Number must be BETWEEN 1 and 30!'\n",
    "Remember that the input data is a STRING by default, so if you need to calculate with it, you need to convert it to FLOAT or INT, e.g.: float(n), int(n)\n",
    "3.Use a WHILE loop to ask for input again and again in case of invalid inputs, until the input is valid\n",
    "4.Create a CUSTOM FUNCTION named ‘is_divisible(number, divisor)’ which checks if the number is divisible by the divisor, if divisible, it should return True (otherwise False)\n",
    "5.Then use FOR loop to loop through the integer numbers between 1 and the number typed by the user, and by using the custom function you created,\n",
    "  a.Print all the EVEN numbers between 1 and the number typed by the user\n",
    "  b.Print all the numbers DIVISIBLE BY 3 between 1 and the number typed by the user \n",
    "Upload your final Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) in ZIP!\n",
